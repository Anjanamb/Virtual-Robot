## Overview

This repository supports the **EN2532 Robot Design Competition** by providing a virtual simulation environment where participants can develop and test their robot behavior before real-world deployment.

The project uses **Webots** as the core simulation engine, offering capabilities for:

- Modeling robot mechanics and sensors
- Running autonomous control software
- Rapid iteration in a virtual setting

Topics: `robotics-competition`, `webots` ([github.com](https://github.com/Anjanamb/Virtual-Robot))

## Quickstart

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anjanamb/Virtual-Robot.git
   cd Virtual-Robot
   ```

2. **Install Webots**  
   If you don’t already have it, download and install [Webots](https://cyberbotics.com) (compatible with Windows/macOS/Linux).

3. **Open the project**  
   Launch Webots and open the simulation world file (e.g., `arena.wbt`) located within the project.

4. **Run the simulation**  
   Within Webots:
   - Use the **Play** button to start.
   - Observe the robot within the arena.
   - Load or attach your control scripts.

## Repository Layout

```
Virtual-Robot/
├─ worlds/              # Webots world files (e.g., arenas, obstacles)
├─ controllers/         # Control logic for robots (C++ or Python)
├─ resources/           # Media and configuration (models, textures)
├─ Makefile             # Build automation for compilation
└─ README.md
```

## Using the Simulation

- **Switch worlds**: Choose different arena setups from the `worlds/` directory.
- **Edit control code**: Modify or create controller programs in `controllers/`, then rebuild (e.g., `make`).
- **Inject sensors or logic**: Add sensors or behaviors, reconfigure the robot, and test in real-time.

---

## Customization & Development

- **Adding new worlds**: Copy an existing `.wbt` world file and adapt obstacle placements or arena design.
- **Robot behavior**: Write autonomous routines in the `controllers/` folder using your preferred language; ensure they’re registered in `Makefile` or project config.
- **Testing and debugging**: Use Webots’ visualization, real-time stepping, and performance counters to tune sensor processing and robot logic.
